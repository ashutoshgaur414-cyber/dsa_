# Minimum Sum of Squared Difference

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given two positive **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`.

The **sum of squared difference** of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is defined as the **sum** of `(nums1[i] - nums2[i])2` for each `0 <= i < n`.

You are also given two positive integers `k1` and `k2`. You can modify any of the elements of `nums1` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k1` times. Similarly, you can modify any of the elements of `nums2` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k2` times.

Return *the minimum **sum of squared difference** after modifying array *`nums1`* at most *`k1`* times and modifying array *`nums2`* at most *`k2`* times*.

**Note**: You are allowed to modify the array elements to become **negative** integers.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4], nums2 = [2,10,20,19], k1 = 0, k2 = 0
Output: 579
Explanation: The elements in nums1 and nums2 cannot be modified because k1 = 0 and k2 = 0. 
The sum of square difference will be: (1 - 2)2 + (2 - 10)2 + (3 - 20)2 + (4 - 19)2 = 579.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,4,10,12], nums2 = [5,8,6,9], k1 = 1, k2 = 1
Output: 43
Explanation: One way to obtain the minimum sum of square difference is: 
- Increase nums1[0] once.
- Increase nums2[2] once.
The minimum of the sum of square difference will be: 
(2 - 5)2 + (4 - 8)2 + (10 - 7)2 + (12 - 9)2 = 43.
Note that, there are other ways to obtain the minimum of the sum of square difference, but there is no way to obtain a sum smaller than 43.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- n == nums1.length == nums2.length
- 1 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 105
- 0 <= k1, k2 <= 109

        long long k = (long long)k1 + k2;
        vector<long long> cnt(100001, 0);
        long long total = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
            int d = abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
            cnt[d]++;
            total += d;
        }

        if (k >= total) return 0;

        for (int d = 100000; d > 0 && k > 0; d--) {
            if (cnt[d] == 0) continue;

            long long move = min(k, cnt[d]);
            cnt[d] -= move;
            cnt[d - 1] += move;
            k -= move;
        }

        long long ans = 0;

        for (int d = 1; d <= 100000; d++) {
            ans += cnt[d] * d * d;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
